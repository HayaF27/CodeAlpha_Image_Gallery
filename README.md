This is a Frontend Development project in which I created an Tmage Gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user can see different collections of photographs in this Image Gallery by pressing the previous and next buttons, which will update the gallery. Also, I added a "Timeout" feature, which means that if the user does not hit the button, the gallery will update automatically.
